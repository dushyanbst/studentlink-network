# API Testing Guide

The backend is now running! Here's how to test each endpoint.

## Quick Start

1. **Start the full application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This runs both frontend (port 8080) and backend (port 3000)

2. **Or run separately**:
   ```bash
   npm run server  # Backend only (port 3000)
   npm run client  # Frontend only (port 8080)
   ```

## Admin Login Credentials

- Email: `admin@university.edu`
- Password: `admin123` (hashed in database)

## Test Endpoints

Step 2 - Verify OTP (use the OTP from console output):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/admin/verify-otp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
